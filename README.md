#LOOPS :)
Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently. The main types are For loops (counting through items) and While loops (based on conditions). Additionally, Nested Loops allow looping within loops for more complex tasks. 

1.For loops are used for sequential traversal. For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. In Python, there is “for in” loop .
For Loop Syntax:
for iterator_var in sequence:
    statements(s)

2.A while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
While Loop Syntax:
while expression:
    statement(s)

3.If we want a block of code to execute infinite number of times then we can use the infinite while loop.


#FUNCTION :)
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
A function can return data as a result.

Creating a Function
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword.

Example
def my_function():
  print("Why is Dan so cute?")

Calling a Function
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis.

Example
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
